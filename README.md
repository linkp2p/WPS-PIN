 The discovery of One algorithm used in WPSPIN have been made parallely and previously by zhaochunsheng in a C. script named computepinC83A35. as i don't known C or
 programming and found this out after coding the first version of WPS, this bash script doesn't use a dingle line of computepinC83A35.
 But it had to be saved that zhaochunsheng found the main algorithm on Chinese access points months before I found it on a new Belkin N router, without knowing it works.
 The page of the author is sadly down and i cannot link you to a straight source
 This code wouldn't have been possible with the help and advices of antares_145, r00tnuLL and 1camaron1, thanks to them billion a billion time :)  
 It wouldn't have been possible neither without my beloved lampiweb.com work crew, maripuri, bentosouto, dirneet, betis-jesus, compota, errboricobueno, pinty_102 nad all users

 greetings to auditoriaswireless.net and thanks to the big chief papones for the hosting and greetings to everybody
 This code uses wps reaver that has to be installed on it own, reaver is a free software  "reaver" (GPL2) by Tactical Network Solutions. Thanks to 
 them for this amazing work
 You also need aircrack-ng, thanks to Mister X and kevin devine for providing the best suite ever (http://www.aircrack-ng.org/)
